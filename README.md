# JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation. It is structured to fulfill the requirements of the "Mastering JavaScript Fundamentals" assignment.

## Features

### Part 1: Variables & Conditionals
- Captures user input (age) using `prompt`.
- Determines if the user is an adult or minor using `if/else`.
- Displays the result dynamically on the webpage.

### Part 2: Functions
- Custom function `greetUser(name)` to greet the user.
- Custom function `calculateTotal(a, b)` to calculate the sum of two numbers.
- Interactive buttons trigger these functions and update the webpage content.

### Part 3: Loops
- Demonstrates a `for` loop to iterate through an array of fruits and display them on the page.
- Demonstrates a `forEach` loop to log fruits in the console.

### Part 4: DOM Manipulation
- Toggle the highlight of a paragraph using a button.
- Update a paragraph based on user input.
- Dynamically add a new paragraph element to the page.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Interact with the buttons and inputs to see JavaScript in action.
